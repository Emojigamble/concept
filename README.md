# ðŸ•¹ Emojigamble

Emojigamble is a fun collection of traditional paper games like TicTacToe, connect4, and Battleship, **but** instead of using `X` and `O`, you play with emojis. Each emoji has either a passive or active ability, which can be used during or at the end of each game. Abilities are upgradable.

You play these games together with your friends or other players from the internet. While playing you win a lot of gems.

As you win gems you can buy new emojis to use within the games. Some emojis have special abilities e.g. increasing the chance for you to win gems or even a lootbox. With gems it is also possible to buy lootboxes and upgrade the abilities of existing emojis. Lootboxes, based on their rarity, can gift you with anything reaching from emojis with specific ability levels to gems.
